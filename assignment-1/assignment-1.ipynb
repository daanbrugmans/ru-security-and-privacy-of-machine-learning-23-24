    "### By Daan Brugmans (s1080742)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the implementation of Assignment 1 for the Radboud University course Security and Privacy of Machine Learning.\n",
    "The topic at hand is to execute and analyze evasion attacks on convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook wil look at targeted and untargeted versions of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and Auto-PGD attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into two parts.\n",
    "In the first part, we will set up and define all components that we need in order to answer the questions posed in the assignment.\n",
    "In the second part, we will answer the questions in a Q&A-style by providing the question, the code that will give us an answer, and the answer itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should show all results without being needed to run.\n",
    "However, if you do want to run this notebook, I have provided a requirements.txt that you can use to install all the required packages."
