    "### Dynamic Computation Graph and Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The information on backpropagation and the dynamic computation graph can be found in the notebook [Introduction to PyTorch](https://colab.research.google.com/github/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2/Introduction_to_PyTorch.ipynb). There you will also find additional information on Tensors similar to the information we already shared in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we already shared, one of the features of tensors is there ability to keep track of the graph of computations that created them (which comes in handy with backpropagation). With PyTorch tensors you can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that you define. In this course we will mainly implement neural networks, which are just fancy functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In those functions, the weight matrices we want to learn are called **parameters** or simply the **weights**. If a neural network outputs a single scalar value, we talk about taking the derivative of that value. However, often times we have to deal with **multiple** output values, which means that we talk about **gradients**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our function by **manipulating** a given input, usually bu matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. A **computation graph** is automatically created when manipulating our input. This graph tells us how to arrive at our output from our input. PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework, which means that we can just do our manipulations and PyTorch will keep track of the computation graph for us (dynamically).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: we only need to compute the output using our function and we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**. \n",
    "\n",
